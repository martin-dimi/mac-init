# Prerequisits
```bash
brew install alacritty
brew install tmux
brew install nvim
git clone https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm ~/.config/tmux/plugins/tpm
```

# Features
* [X] Full fledged Nvim support
* [X] Beutiful font 🧑‍🍳 `Cascadia Mono NF`
* [X] Tmux built-in with alacritty 
* [X] Avante support (similar to Cursor AI)
* [X] Add markdown support. 

# Potential changes
* Maybe time to leave alacritty. Try ghost when it comes out
* Potentially try `fish`?
